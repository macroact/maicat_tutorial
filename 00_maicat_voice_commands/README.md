# Maicat Tutorial
### Booting

When you switch Maicat on, Maicat's ROS environment will be prepared, which will take about a minute or more.<br/>
Once the robot is ready, it will respond to touch on its head and back by moving its head and tail and changing the shape of its eyes.

### Turn On Voice Recognition
When you touch Maicat's head and back, the voice recognition feature starts to prepare, which takes about a minute.<br/>
After that, try saying “Maicat”. When the robot is ready, it will respond with a “meow”.

&nbsp;
### Voice Conversation
Once the voice recognition feature is ready, you can have a conversation using ChatGPT.<br/>
You can ask questions about any information you want and get answers.<br/>
However, since ChatGPT does not include location information, it cannot answer questions that require location, such as 'Tomorrow's weather' or 'Good restaurants nearby'.

&nbsp;
### Voice Commands
Once the voice recognition feature is ready, you can give voice commands.<br/>
We currently support the following commands and will continue to update them.<br/>
- 'Get up' : It is used to make the robot stand up from the charging station.
- 'Move forward' : The robot will take 8 steps forward
- 'Turn left' : Turns to the left.
- 'Turn right' : Turns to the right.
- 'Go back' : Moves backwards.
- 'Sit' : Sits down.
- 'Stand up' : Stands up from a seated position.
- 'Balance' : Keeping its balance. Try and put the robot on a hard device such as a tray, and slowly tilt it in different directions.
- 'Lie down' : Takes a lying position.
- 'Stop now' : Shuts down the system. When the eye display turns off, press the power button to completely turn the robot off.
