# Maicat_TOF_Sensor (Time of Flight)

Maicat uses ToF sensor data to detect obstacles and integrates this information into the robot's navigation algorithms. It also monitors specific distances to prevent collisions and measures distances for positioning. We combine the ToF sensor data with the IMU sensor to enhance the accuracy of mapping and navigation.
