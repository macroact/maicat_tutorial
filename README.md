### Charging Station Assembly
Note the small grooves on the charger and rug that mark their orientation, as well as the protrusions on the bottom of the charger. Push them together in the direction of the grooves.<br/>
Connect the jack on the adapter to the connector on the edge of the rug, then plug the adapter into an outlet.

## Switching on Maicat
To use the robot, you must first remove the battery seal on the belly, as shown in the image below.
Then, press the power button infront of the tail to turn it on.<br/>
Place Maicat on the charging station as shown in the image. When the power is turned on, the eye display will show the form of closed eyes.
