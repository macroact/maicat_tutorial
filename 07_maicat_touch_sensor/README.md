# Maicat Tutorial
# Maicat Touch Sensor

Maicat is equipped with three touch sensors and located at:
Head: Top of the head
Back Head: Rear part of the head
Back: Middle section of the back

When any of these sensors are touched, the robot responds with various expressions and a "meow" sound to engage with the user in a friendly way.

# Head Sensor
When you gently touch the sensor at the top of the head, the robot will respond with a joyful expression and a playful "meow" sound, creating a delightful interaction.
# Back Head Sensor
Touching the sensor at the back of the head triggers a different expression and a happy "meow" to acknowledge your touch.
# Back Sensor
When you touch the sensor located in the middle of the back, the robot will react with yet another unique expression and sound, designed to bring you closer to it emotionally.

```python
cd /maicat_automatic
