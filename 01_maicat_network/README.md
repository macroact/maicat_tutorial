# Maicat Tutorial
## Setting up Network:

Pairing
After logging in, the user will be prompted to either establish a Bluetooth connection with an existing Maicat or to set up a new connection. If an option is selected, the app will scan for nearby Maicat. Choose one of the scanned Maicat and attempt to connect.
Wi-Fi Settings
Search for networks that Maicat can connect to. Select your desired network from the list of available options, enter the correct password for your network, and Maicat will connect to the selected network.
