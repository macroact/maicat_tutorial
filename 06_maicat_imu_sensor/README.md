# Maicat Tutorial
# Maicat_Imu_Sensor

The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor is used to maintain balance in the Maicat robot. An IMU combines accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers to measure acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic field strength along different axes. When integrated into the robotâ€™s control system, the data from the IMU helps compute Maicat's current tilt and movement status. The control system can then adjust the motors to maintain or restore balance.
